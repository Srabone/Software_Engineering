# Software_Engineering on 'AIUB Smart-Dine: Modernizing Campus Dining' 
The objective of this project is to enhance the dining experience for students at AIUB by addressing the recurring issues in the campus canteen. Our goal is to design and implement a Smart Canteen System that solves problems related to overcrowding, cash-only payments, limited seating, food wastage, and the risk of students missing meals.
